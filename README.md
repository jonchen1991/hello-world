Starting out with GitHub

Hi, pandastyle00 here! 
I'm just starting out on GitHub and I'm using this as a repository as I learn Python, C/C++/C#/Objective C, and Java.
I will also use this to as a repository as I update my skills in Perl and R.

Finally, I will use this as a log of my journey as I try to learn more about the programming world and my attempts to immerse myself in it.
